      point, but cannot be rotated.


      After time is unpaused, missiles will
      fly directly toward the direction they are facing and explode upon hitting
      any object. Civilians, enemies, and allies will be killed if they are in the
      explosion radius. Fragile boxes will be destroyed.'
