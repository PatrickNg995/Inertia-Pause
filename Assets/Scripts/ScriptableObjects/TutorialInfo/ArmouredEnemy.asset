  - Content: Armoured enemies are a variant of the regular enemy equipped with ballistic
      armour. They take reduced damage from all bullet types, needing two hits from
      bullets to kill the enemy. Explosions, fall damage, and other sources of damage
      will still kill the enemy instantly.

  - Content: 'Like regular enemies, shielded enemies can be moved in any direction
      within 1 meter of the starting point, but cannot be rotated.


      After
      time is unpaused, enemies will remain stationary but react to gravity. Falling
      from a one storey height or greater will kill the enemy.


      To complete
      the scenario, all enemies must be killed.'
