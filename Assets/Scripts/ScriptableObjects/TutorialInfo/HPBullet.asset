      point, but cannot be rotated.


      After time is unpaused, bullets will
      fly directly toward the direction they are facing. Civilians, enemies, and
      allies will be killed if they are hit by the bullet. Fragile boxes will be
      destroyed.


      Normal bullets can only hit one object before being ineffective.'
