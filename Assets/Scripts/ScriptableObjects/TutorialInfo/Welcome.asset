  - Content: 'Welcome to Inertia Pause!


      You are an officer in the Inertia
      City Police Department (ICPD) Unit 5, working to save lives in the most harrowing
      situations. Fortunately, you have the miraculous ability to freeze time, which
      comes in handy as innocent lives are often a split second from being lost...'

  - Content: 'While time is frozen, you can walk up to objects and interact with
      them. Some objects can be moved, while others are a one-shot effect.


      Once
      you are sure all the enemies will die and all allies will live, unpause time
      and see what happens!'

  - Content: You can press TAB while hovering over any interactable object for a
      description on what you can do with the object and what will happen when time
      is unpaused. Good luck!
