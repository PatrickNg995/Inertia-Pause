  - Content: 'Bullets can be moved in any direction within 4 meters of the starting
      point, but cannot be rotated.


      After time is unpaused, bullets will
      fly directly toward the direction they are facing. Civilians, enemies, and
      allies will be killed if they are hit by the bullet. Fragile boxes will be
      destroyed.


      Unstoppable bullets will inflict damage on every object
      in its trajectory and pass through all objects, including walls and enemy shields.'
