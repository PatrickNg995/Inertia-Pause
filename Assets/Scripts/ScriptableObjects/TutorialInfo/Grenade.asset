  - Content: 'Grenades can be moved in any direction within 4 meters of the starting
      point, but cannot be rotated.


      After time is unpaused, the grenade will
      fly in an arc toward the trajectory indicated and explode after a short delay.
      Other lethal objects, such as explosions from other grenades, will cause the
      grenade to explode immediately. Civilians, enemies, and allies will be killed
      if they are in the explosion radius.'
