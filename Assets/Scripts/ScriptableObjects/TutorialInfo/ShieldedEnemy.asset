  - Content: Shielded enemies are a variant of the regular enemy equipped with a
      ballistic shield. The shield will block all bullets, but the enemy is still
      vulnerable to explosions.

  - Content: 'Like regular enemies, shielded enemies can be moved in any direction
      within 1 meter of the starting point, but cannot be rotated.


      After
      time is unpaused, enemies will remain stationary but react to gravity. Falling
      from a one storey height or greater will kill the enemy.


      To complete
      the scenario, all enemies must be killed.'
